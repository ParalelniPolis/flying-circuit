  <h2> Competition tracks </h2>
  <p>
    This year's Flying Circuit focuses on topics such as cloud society and urban hacktivism.
    Hackers can choose to either to build new solutions or break an existing nonsense.
    The hacking teams will have to prove a combination of their technical skill, artistic ability and scientific diligence.
